# EasyMusicLight
A project to control a WS2812b LED-stripe with a Arduino nano regarding to sound.

The version 1.0 is the result of a project for the course “EE8205 - Embedded Computer Systems - F2021” at Ryerson university that’s part of the masters degree in electrical and computer engineering. I am looking forward to find the time to add new modes and new features and releasing them in a new version.

The software uses the following libraries:

-Arduino_FreeRTOS

-fix_fft

-Adafruit_NeoPixel
